# My portfolio-backend

Welcome to my portfolio-backend repository where I have built with Python and Flask.

## About

This repository serves as a playground for refining my coding expertise.

## API link

The API is available [here]() deployed as live app using Heroku.

## Frontend repository

For the frontend counterpart of my portfolio, have a look at [frontend Github repository](https://github.com/gregWDumont/portfolio-frontend), where I showcase my coding skills and projects using React, Axios, and GitHub Pages.
